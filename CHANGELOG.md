## [0.1.4] - 2025-01-14

### Changed
- **Major Improvement**: Configuration extraction now reads from CSV profiler output instead of parsing text with regex
- Replaced 50+ complex regex patterns with structured CSV data parsing
- Enhanced `extract_test_config_and_status()` function to prioritize CSV data over text parsing
- Added new `extract_config_from_csv()` function for reliable configuration extraction

### Fixed
- More accurate shape, dtype, and layout detection from profiler results
- Improved reliability of configuration reporting in test summaries
- Better handling of tensor dimension parsing (e.g., "32[32]" format)

### Technical
- CSV-based extraction provides structured, consistent data vs. unreliable text parsing
- Maintains backward compatibility with text parsing as fallback
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with reduced complexity
